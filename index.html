                <p>
                    Later that day, when the Princess was sitting at the table, something was heard coming up the marble stairs. Splish, splosh, splish splosh! The sound came nearer and nearer, and a voice cried, "Let me in, youngest daughter of the King."
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Princess jumped up to see who had called her. Now when she caught sight of the frog, she turned very pale.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "What does a frog want with you?" demanded the King, looking rather surprised.
