        <p>
        Sometimes traveling is like a walk in paradise, you will see the best landscape on the journey.<br />
        You will get help and love from everyone and everywhere.<br />
        Sometimes traveling is like a romantic story,<br />
        you will meet a lover by chance who waits for you, somewhere and somebody.<br />
        Sometimes traveling is like the action of charity<br />
        you bring the hope to the local people you help them and they help you too.<br />
        Sometimes traveling is like a war, you have to defend for yourself and your belongings will feel tired,<br />
        exhausted lonely weak and miss your family. But you will be stronger and prouder of yourself.<br />
        Traveling is like a poem. You use your footprint to fill in every word and every sentence.<br />
        In the poem, fill in your emotion, your story and your entire life.<br /><br />
