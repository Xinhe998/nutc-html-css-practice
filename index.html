                You will get help and love from everyone and everywhere.<br/>
                Sometimes traveling is like a romantic story,<br/>
                you will meet a lover by chance who waits for you,somewhere and somebody.<br/>
                Sometimes traveling is like the action of charity,<br/>
                you bring the hope to the local people you help them and they help you too.<br/>
                Sometimes traveling is like a war,you have to defend for yourself and your belongings will feel tired,<br/>
                wxhausted lonely,weak and miss your family.But you will be stronger and prouder of yourself.<br/>
                Traveling is like a poem.You use your footprint to fill in every word and every sentence.<br/>
                In the poem,fill in your emotion,your story and your entire life.
