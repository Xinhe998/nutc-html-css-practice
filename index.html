                    Sometimes traveling is like a walk in paradise, you will see the best landscape on the journey.</br>
                    You will get help and love from everyone and everywhere.</br>
                    Sometimes traveling is like a romantic story,</br>
                    you will meet a lover by chance who waits for you, somewhere and somebody.</br>
                    Sometimes traveling is like the action of charity</br>
                    you bring the hope to the local people you help them and they help you too.</br>
                    Sometimes traveling is like a war, you have to defend for yourself and your belongings will feel tired,</br>
                    exhausted lonely, weak and miss your family. But you will be stronger and prouder of yourself.</br>
                    Traveling is like a poem. You use your footprint to fill in every word and every sentence.</br>
                    In the poem, fill in your emotion, your story and your entire life</br>
